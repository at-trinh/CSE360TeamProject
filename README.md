## Project Scope
This project was to make an update to EffortLogger that supported new Agile planning techniques.

## Build

To build from scratch, install a version of Java 21 that has JFX included in the JRE. For this project, Bellsoft Liberica 21.0.1 JDK was used. This can be downloaded [here](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/).

Once you have java 21 installed, make sure it is the current version being used by opening your terminal and entering `java -version`. If the version isn't right, you may need to edit your system path.

Now you can open your terminal and navigate to where this project is installed. To build the program enter `mvnw.cmd clean install` if you are on windows and `./mvnw clean install` if you are on MacOS or Linux.

## Install

Download the latest build for your system and run the installer.
